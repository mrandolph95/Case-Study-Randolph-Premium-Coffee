Randolph’s Premium Coffee: Automated Data Extraction, Reporting, and Data Visualization

Description:
Developed a Python automation script to extract data from YouTube and GitHub, streamline report generation, and create data visualizations in Power BI. The project involved several stages, including:

  •	Web Scraping: Wrote Python code to automate web scraping using Selenium to control a Chrome browser, navigate YouTube, search for videos by specific titles, and open    corresponding video pages.
  
  •	Data Extraction: Implemented the extraction of hyperlinks to GitHub repositories within the video’s "More Information" section, followed by navigating to those links to download relevant Excel data files.
  
  •	Data Processing: Processed the downloaded Excel file by utilizing Excel functions such as INDEX MATCH and IF formulas to fill in missing values and perform data validation.
  •	Automation: Automated the entire process of data extraction, file handling, and report generation in Excel using Python, optimizing efficiency and reducing manual effort.
  
  •	Data Visualization: Visualized the final dataset in Power BI, creating interactive reports and dashboards to present insights clearly and effectively.
  
Skills used: Python (Selenium, xlwings), Excel (INDEX MATCH, IF formulas), Power BI, Web Scraping, Data Automation
